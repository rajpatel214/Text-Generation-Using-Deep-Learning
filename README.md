# Text Generation Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on text generation using deep learning techniques. The goal is to train a model to generate text based on an input dataset.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset containing text data.
   - Clean the text by removing unwanted characters, punctuations, and stopwords.
   - Tokenize and transform the text into sequences for training.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze the total number of words and unique words in the dataset.
   - Visualize word distribution using bar charts.

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Convert the text into sequences for training.
   - Define a sequence length and prepare the dataset for model input.
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

4. **Model Building**
   - Define a deep learning model using LSTM layers.
   - Use an embedding layer to convert words into numerical representations.
   - Add dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
   - Compile the model with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

5. **Model Training**
   - Train the model on the processed text data.
   - Use batch processing to efficiently train the model.
   - Monitor loss and accuracy during training.

6. **Model Evaluation & Saving**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
   - Save the trained model for future use.

7. **Text Generation**
   - Use the trained model to generate new text sequences.
   - Provide an input sequence to generate predictions.
   
## Project Outcome
The model learns from the dataset and generates meaningful text sequences based on input. This can be further improved by training on larger datasets or fine-tuning hyperparameters.
